This directory contains files which are generated. The reason, that they are
here and not in the build directory, is that this enables to build JagPDF even
on platforms without 3rd party tools (like gccxml or python) that are required
to generate these files.

If CMake detects a required tool, then the files are generated to the build
directory and the files here are updated only if they differ.

If there isn't the required tool, the files are copied to the build directory.
